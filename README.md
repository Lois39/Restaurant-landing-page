#Restaurant Landing Page

This is a team project by Clive Chambers and Okereke Lois.
Overview
Both are expected to mimic the design below as possible as they can:
 
To be able to complete this we’ll both have to have a basic understanding of HTML and CSS but other frontend languages can also be used to complete it.
We should be able to:
1. Know and understand the use of CSS flexbox and grid layout because that’s what was mostly displayed in the preview design.
2. We should put the hover states wherever they are needed i.e at interactive element.
Deploying the project 
There are many ways to host the project for free. Our recommend hosts are:
. Github pages: https://pages.github.com
. Vercel: https://vercel.com
. Netlify: https://www.netlify.com

Hope we have both fun building this project together	.
